  ## Description 
  
  Note Taker is an app that lets a user write, save, and delete notes. To add a note, click the pencil icon in the top right corner of the screen. When the title and the text body of the note have been fill, clicking the save button will keep the note in the left column of the screen. To preview any of the previous notes, simply click on the title of the note and the note will be visible on the right column. To remove a note from the saved notes, click the trash can icon next to the note. This application uses an Express.js back end to save and retieve note data from a JSON file.
